# EM-Based-Haplotype-Reconstruction-Algorithms
This repository provides code for post-processing haplotype reconstruction algorithms based on the E-M framework, as detailed in "Reconstructing Haplotype Structure and Frequencies from Reads Data" (Wang, 2024). It includes a coloring-based and residual-based method to enhance accuracy and computational efficiency for short-read sequencing data.
